## About EmpowerChange

### üìñ Overview
Initially developed for managing a Homeless Care Programme, EmpowerChange is a versatile system that can be tailored to cater to a wide range of services for those in need. Its core mission is to empower field workers, equipping them with a dynamic tool to drive positive change.

### üåü Key Features
- **Beneficiary-Centric Design:** The Beneficiary DocType captures all essential information about the individual receiving services.
- **Case Management:** Facilitates the identification and fulfillment of needs. Multiple people can be assigned to a case, promoting collaboration and efficiency.
- **Rescue Operations:** The Rescue DocType tracks in-field rescue operations, with a Geo-location field for exact location pinpointing.
- **Service Tracking:** A variety of service-related DocTypes to monitor services offered to beneficiaries, such as Food Distribution, Entitlement Request, and Shelter Home Admission/Exit.
- **User Profile:** Stores additional user information, including Designation and Organisation.
